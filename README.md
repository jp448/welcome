# Welcome
Wecome is an networking app that helps expats navigate their new home environments. 

**Introduction**

This app was created in two weeks during the Le Wagon bootcamp. It is built with Ruby on Rails using a postgres database. The frontend uses the bootstrap framework and Sass. It was created in a team with 3 other Le Wagon Students as the final project. Users can sign up to the app to access articles on the topic of living abroad and book mentors to help advise them on a variety of problems.

**App Description**

Users can sign up or sign in to see all the material on offer on the Welcome app. There are two main components of the app, first the article section which has a selection of articles written by Mentors who work at welcome. Users can read these articles on different topics such as how to submit taxes, bringing your pet from your home country, finding a flat etc). If a user finds the article particularly helpful or interesting the user can connect right away with the Mentor who wrote it and see the mentor's profile. Each of the Mentors specialize in different topics depending on their own background. Users can then book Mentors for an advisor session to get advise and help resolving any issues they are facing as they move (or after they have moved) to a new country.  

**App Improvements**

If I had more time here are the improvements I would make to the app: 
* Make the design responsive
* account for avaliblity when doing bookings
* add unit tests
* improve search bar
* make more material accessible to the user before signing in
